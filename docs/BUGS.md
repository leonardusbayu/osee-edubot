# EduBot Bug & Issue Log

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for known bugs, fixes shipped, and deferred
design work. New Claude sessions read this first (via CLAUDE.md reference) so
we don't rediscover issues from scratch every conversation.

**Conventions:**
- Status: `open` | `fixed` | `deferred` | `wontfix`
- Priority: `P0` (breaks core UX), `P1` (degrades UX), `P2` (polish / follow-up)
- Each fixed item links to its commit SHA. Open items link to a GitHub issue
  when one exists.

**Workflow:** end of each working session, append new findings. When a fix
ships, move it from Open → Fixed with the commit hash.

| # | P | Area | Title | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|------|-------|:-----:|-------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~frontend/worker~~ | ~~Offline sync silently drops answers at maxRetries~~ | ~~[#1](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/1)~~ | **FIXED (F15 + F25)** — UI banner + manual retry (F15) + server-side idempotency via client_uuid (F25, migration 052). |
| ~~2~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Diagnostic test has no per-answer audit log~~ | ~~[#2](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/2)~~ | **FIXED (F16)** — migration 050_diagnostic_answer_log.sql + submitAnswer writes rows + buildStudentReport surfaces them. |
| ~~3~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Tutor chat — no per-turn evidence/metadata~~ | ~~[#5](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/5)~~ | **FIXED (F28)** — migration 051 + `persistConversationMessage` helper tags all 6 INSERT sites with topic + is_confusion. |
| ~~4~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Speaking dimension scores silently dropped on error~~ | — | **FIXED (F26)** — session update + dim insert now in separate try/catches; dim failures stamp a diagnostic flag on session.feedback so admin tools can filter. |
| ~~5~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Game score + XP award not atomic~~ | — | **FIXED (F27)** — all 6 game endpoints now call awardXp first then INSERT game_scores with the real xp_earned. Phantom `xp_earned=0` rows eliminated. |
| ~~6~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Lesson steps never advance on natural completion~~ | ~~[#3](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/3)~~ | **FIXED (F17)** — explicit "✅ Selesai step ini" button + lesson_complete_X callback. Auto-advance on CQ pass deferred (not yet measured if needed). |
| ~~7~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~/progress + /profile bot commands don't use buildStudentReport~~ | — | **FIXED (F22)** — both now call buildStudentReport + dedicated formatters in bot-report-formatters.ts. |
| ~~8~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Coin shop — coins earned but no spend path~~ | ~~[#6](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/6)~~ | **FIXED (F18)** — `/shop` command + purchase callback; streak_freeze and extra_questions fully wired; others refund with "coming soon" |
| ~~9~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~League leaderboard never surfaced~~ | — | **FIXED (F19)** — `/leaderboard` + `/league` bot commands show top 10 + user's rank |
| ~~10~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~League promotion/demotion silent~~ | ~~[#7](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/7)~~ | **FIXED (F20)** — `notifyLeagueChanges()` fires after weekly cron; Telegram messages for promote/demote events |
| ~~11~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Friend quests never complete~~ | ~~[#8](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/8)~~ | **FIXED (F21)** — `recordQuestEvent()` hooked into `awardXp`; quests now progress, complete, and grant coin rewards |
| ~~12~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~Companion doesn't re-enrich mental-model from its own chat~~ | — | **FIXED (F23)** — [CONCEPT: tag; state: misconception\|partial\|solid] parsed from GPT reply; recordEvidence/recordMisconception called with weight 0.3–0.4. |
| ~~13~~ | ~~P1~~ | ~~ops~~ | ~~CI runs are red since Apr 13~~ | ~~[#4](https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/4)~~ | **FIXED** — see F13 below. |
| ~~14~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~content~~ | ~~TOEFL ITP error-id rows with blank content~~ | — | **SCRIPT READY (F24)** — `scripts/cleanup-broken-itp-error-id.sql` marks bad rows as draft. Dry-run command in the script header. Operator runs once. |
| ~~15~~ | ~~P2~~ | ~~worker~~ | ~~findIdleStudents HAVING-clause flag~~ | — | **N/A — already fixed** in a previous session via subquery rewrite. Comment at companion.ts:428–430 documents the original pitfall. No live bug. |

purged after F8 so stale corrupted cache entries no longer serve.

## Design decisions pending (not bugs, but shape affects fix)

- **What signals "lesson step completed"?** Fixes #6. Options: (a) explicit "Done" button, (b) CQ passed correctly, (c) N tutor turns on topic.
- **Offline sync idempotency:** Fixes #1. Options: (a) client-side UUID + server-side dedup, (b) optimistic UI with rollback on eventual sync failure.
- **Diagnostic audit shape:** Fixes #2. Options: (a) new `diagnostic_question_answers` table, (b) reuse `attempt_answers` with a diagnostic-flag column.

## Process

When a new bug is found:
1. Add a row to "Currently open" with priority + area + one-line symptom
2. If non-trivial, open a GitHub issue: https://github.com/leonardusbayu/osee-edubot/issues/new
3. Reference the issue number in the row: `Notes: #42`

When a fix ships:
1. Move the row to "Recently fixed" with commit SHA
2. Close the GitHub issue (if one exists) with the commit in the closing comment

Prune "Recently fixed" to the last 7 days so the file stays scannable.
